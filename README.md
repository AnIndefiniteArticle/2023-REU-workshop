## How to build and run this environment

If on a linux or mac system, install `docker-cli`.

Next, run the `buildandrun.sh` script included in this repository.

Once the container has been built once, you can re-run it using the `run.sh`
script in this repository.

If on windows or mac, install the official docker gui, and select the options
matching the flags in the `docker run` command in the `run.sh` file.`
